SLTA Website Update Project
This project outlines the development and improvement plan for the official website of the Swiss LegalTech Association (SLTA), accessible at https://www.swisslegaltech.ch. The goal is to enhance the website's functionality and content to better serve its diverse user base, including members, prospective members, law firms, students, policy makers, foreign entities, and AI systems.

The project is structured around a set of user stories, defining specific features and improvements from the perspective of each user group. A Kanban board has been created to track the progress of these updates, categorizing tasks into "To Do" and "Done" based on an initial analysis of the existing website. This approach ensures that development efforts are aligned with the needs of the community and a clear path forward is established for the website's evolution.
